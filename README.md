### RECOMMENDATION
- There is a high demand for technology based products. The company should channel more of her production energy to tech based products to meet market demand and maximise profit.
- A market survey should be done at regions like west and Yukon to understand the customers needs in the region so as to know the products that can best suit them.
- The top 8 most profitable customers buy technology based items.
- The company should have a separate and more responsive dest to give priority to the corporate customer as they make most number of orders.
- The company should take feedbacks from the customers that returned items to know how to improve on their products as 10.1% return rate is much for the company's reputation.

Thank you
